# even_faster_git
setup of aliases and different configs for an even faster development process using Git (global information tracker) commands.




## How to Edit the Global Git Config File Directly:

### Append the aliases directly into your `./gitconfig` :
>> curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muten-Roshi-Sama/even_faster_git/main/append_aliases.txt >> ~/.gitconfig


### Verifying the results : 
```
# View the end of your config file to see the addition
cat ~/.gitconfig

# Test one of your new aliases
git st
```

WIP: 
- this only append the aliases text to your gitconfig, you need to manually delete them before appending the new ones
